## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk Level: MEDIUM

**Reasoning:**
- Most vulnerabilities require local file system access
- No remote code execution vectors identified
- Exploitability requires specific conditions
- Modern OS protections (ASLR, NX, stack canaries) provide defense-in-depth

### Attack Scenarios

**Most Likely:**
1. Malicious squashfs image causes buffer overflow during extraction
2. Deeply nested directory structure causes stack overflow (DoS)
3. Crafted file names with long paths trigger integer overflow

**Least Likely:**
1. Remote exploitation (tool is local)
2. Privilege escalation (runs with user privileges)
3. Persistent compromise (no daemon mode)

2. Check methodology (AUDIT_METHODOLOGY.md)
3. Review recommendations (SECURITY_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)
4. Create GitHub issue for discussion

## Conclusion

The squashfs-tools codebase demonstrates good security awareness in some areas (integer overflow protection) but has room for improvement in others (string handling, recursive operations). 

**No critical vulnerabilities** were found that would allow remote code execution or privilege escalation under normal usage. The identified issues are:
- **Exploitable** with specific conditions (malicious input files)
- **Mitigatable** with straightforward code changes
- **Testable** with existing security tools

The project would benefit from:
1. Adopting modern security tools (sanitizers, fuzzing)
2. Replacing unsafe string operations
3. Adding comprehensive security tests
4. Establishing continuous security practices

**Overall Assessment:** The code is reasonably secure but should implement the recommended improvements to meet modern security standards.
