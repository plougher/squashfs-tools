.SH NAME
mksquashfs - tool to create and append to squashfs filesystems
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fI\,source1 source2 \/\fR...  \fI\,FILESYSTEM \/\fR[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR] [\fI\,-e list of exclude dirs/files\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.
It uses either gzip/xz/lzo/lz4/zstd compression to compress both files, inodes
and directories.  Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are
packed to minimise data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported
up to a maximum of 1Mbytes (default block size 128K).

Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained
block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is
needed.

add the xattr NAME with VAL to files.  If an user xattr it will be added to regular files and directories (see man 7 xattr).  Otherwise it will be added to all files.  VAL by default will be treated as binary (i.e. an uninterpreted byte sequence), but it can be prefixed with 0s, where it will be treated as base64 encoded, or prefixed with 0x, where val will be treated as hexidecimal.  Additionally it can be prefixed with 0t where this encoding is similar to binary encoding, except backslashes are specially treated, and a backslash followed by 3 octal digits can be used to encode any ASCII character, which obviously can be used to encode control codes.  The option can be repeated multiple times to add multiple xattrs.

.SS "Tar file only options:"
.TP
\fB\-default\-mode\fR MODE
tar files often do not store permissions for intermediate directories.  This option sets the default directory permissions to MODE.  MODE can be symbolic or octal (see section Symbolic mode specification). Default mode is u=rwx,go=rx or 0755 octal.  This also sets the root directory mode.
.TP
\fB\-default\-uid\fR VALUE
tar files often do not store uids for intermediate directories.  This option sets the default directory owner to VALUE, rather than the user running Mksquashfs.  VALUE can be either an integer uid or user name.  This also sets the root directory uid.
.TP
\fB\-default\-gid\fR VALUE
tar files often do not store gids for intermediate directories.  This option sets the default directory group to VALUE, rather than the group of the user running Mksquashfs.  VALUE can be either an integer uid or group name.  This also sets the root directory gid.
.TP
\fB\-ignore\-zeros\fR
allow tar files to be concatenated together and fed to Mksquashfs.  Normally a tarfile has two consecutive 512 byte blocks filled with zeros which means EOF and Mksquashfs will stop reading after the first tar file on encountering them. This option makes Mksquashfs ignore the zero filled blocks.
.SS "Expert options (these may make the filesystem unmountable):"
.TP
\fB\-nopad\fR
do not pad filesystem to a multiple of 4K.

.SH "SYMBOLIC MODE SPECIFICATION"
The symbolic mode is of the format [ugoa]*[[+\-=]PERMS]+.  PERMS = [rwxXst]+ or
[ugo], and the sequence can be repeated separated with commas.
.PP
A combination of the letters ugoa specify which permission bits will be
affected, u means user, g means group, o means other, and a means all or ugo.
.PP
The next letter is +, \- or =.  The letter + means add to the existing permission
bits, \- means remove the bits from the existing permission bits, and = means set
the permission bits.
.PP
The permission bits (PERMS) are a combination of [rwxXst] which
sets/adds/removes those bits for the specified ugoa combination, r means read, w
means write and x means execute for files or search for directories.  X has a
special meaning, if the file is a directory it is equivalent to x or search, but
if it is a non\-directory, it only takes effect if execute is already set for
user, group or other.  The s flag sets user or group ID on execution, and the t
flag on a directory sets restricted deletion, or historically made the file
sticky if a non\-directory.
.PP
The permission bits can also be u, g or o, which takes the permission bits from
the user, group or other of the file respectively.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"

If set, this is used as the directory to write the file sqfs_cmdline which contains the command line arguments given to Mksquashfs.  Each command line argument is wrapped in quotes to ensure there is no ambiguity when arguments contain spaces.  If the file already exists then the command line is appended to the file.
.TP
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
If set, this is used as the filesystem creation timestamp.  Also any file timestamps which are after SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH will be clamped to SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH. See https://reproducible\-builds.org/docs/source\-date\-epoch/ for more information.

PAGER
If set, this is used as the name of the program used to display the help text.  The value can be a simple command or a pathname.  The default is \fI\,/usr/bin/pager\/\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS
Create a Squashfs filesystem from the contents of DIRECTORY, writing the output
to IMAGE.SQFS.  Mksquashfs will use the default compressor (normally gzip), and
a block size of 128 Kbytes.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY FILE1 FILE2 IMAGE.SQFS
Create a Squashfs filesystem containing DIRECTORY and FILE1 and FILE2.  If
multiple sources are specified on the command line they will be combined into
a single directory.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -b 1M -comp zstd
Use a block size of 1 Mbyte and Zstandard compression to create the filesystem. 
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -all-time now
Set all file and directory timestamps to "now" (current time) in the filesystem.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -force-uid phillip -force-gid phillip
Make all files and directories in the filesystem owned by "phillip".
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -force-file-mode ugo+r,go-w
Make all files readable by everyone, but only writable by user, all other
permission bits are unaffected.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -e file1 file2
Exclude file1 and file2 from DIRECTORY when creating filesystem.  No wildcard
matching of files.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -wildcards -e "*.gz"
Exclude anything in DIRECTORY which matches the wildcard pattern "*.gz".
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -wildcards -e "... *.gz"
Exclude files which match the wildcard pattern "*.gz" anywhere within DIRECTORY
and its sub-directories.  The initial "..." indicates the wildcard pattern is
"non-anchored" and will match anywhere.
.PP
Note: when passing wildcarded names to Mksquashfs, they should be quoted (as in
the above examples), to ensure that they are not processed by the shell.

.SS Using pseudo file definitions
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -p "build_dir d 0644 0 0"
Create a directory called "build_dir" in the output filesystem.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -p "version.txt l /tmp/build/version"
Create a reference called "version.txt" to a file outside DIRECTORY, which acts
as if the file "/tmp/build/version" was copied or hard-linked into DIRECTORY
before calling Mksquashfs.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -p "date.txt f 0644 0 0 date"
Create a file called "date.txt" which holds the output (stdout) from running
the "date" command.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -p "\\"hello world\\" f 0644 0 0 date"
As above, but, showing that filenames can have spaces, if they are quoted.
The quotes need to be blackslashed to protect them from the shell.
.TP
mksquashfs - IMAGE.SQFS -p "input f 0644 root root dd if=/dev/sda1 bs=1024" -p "/ d 0644 0 0"
Create a file containing the contents of partition /dev/sda1".  Ordinarily
Mksquashfs given a device, fifo, or named socket will place that special file
within the Squashfs filesystem, the above allows input from these special files
to be captured and placed in the Squashfs filesystem.   Note there are no other
sources than the pseudo file, and so the command line source is "-".  If there
are no other sources than pseudo files, the root (/) directory must be defined
too, as seen in this example.
.TP
unsquashfs -pf - IMAGE.SQFS | mksquashfs - NEW.SQFS -pf -
Transcode IMAGE.SQFS to NEW.SQFS by piping the pseudo file output from
Unsquashfs to Mksquashfs using stdout and stdin.  This can convert from
earlier Squashfs filesystems or change compression algorithm, block size etc.
without needing to unpack into an intermediate directory or file.
.PP
Note: pseudo file definitions should be quoted (as in the above examples), to
ensure that they are passed to Mksquashfs as a single argument, and to ensure
that they are not processed by the shell.

.SS Using extended attribute options
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -no-xattrs
Do not store any extended attributes in the Squashfs filesystem.  Any extended
attributes in the source files will be ignored.

extended attributes in the user namespace in the Squashfs filesystem.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -xattrs-add "user.comment=hello world"
Add the extended attribute called "user.comment" with the content "hello world"
to all files and directories in the Squashfs filesystem.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -xattrs-add "user.comment=0thello world\\012"
Add the extended attribute called "user.comment" to all files and directories,
but in this case the contents of the extended attribute will be "hello world"
with a trailing newline character (012 octal).
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -xattrs-add "user.comment=0saGVsbG8gd29ybGQ="
Add the extended attribute called "user.comment" to all files and directories,
where the value is given in base64 encoding, representing "hello world".
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -action "-xattrs-include(^user.) @ type(f)"
Filter the extended attributes but only in regular files (type f), and only
store extended attributes in the user namespace.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -p "hello_world x user.comment=0tsalve mundi\\012"
Add the extended attribute called "user.comment" to the file called
"hello_world", with the contents of the extended attribute being "salve mundi"
with a trailing newline character (012 octal).

.SS Using Actions to not compress, change attributes etc.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -action "uncompressed @ (name(*.jpg) || name(*.mpg) ) || (name(*.img) && filesize(+1G))"
Specify that any files matching the wildcards "*.jpg" and "*.mpg" should not be
compressed.  Additionally, it also specifies any files matching the wildcard
"*.img" and are larger than 1 Gigabyte should be uncompressed too.  This shows
test operators can be combined with logical expressions.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -action "chmod(o+r)@! perm(o+r)"
If any files within DIRECTORY are not readable by "others", then make them
readable by others in the Squashfs filesystem.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -action "uid(phillip)@! perm(o+r)"
As previous, match on any files which are not readable by "others", but, in
this case change the owner of the file to "phillip" in the Squashfs filesystem.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -action "prune @ type(l) && ! exists"
Delete any symbolic link within DIRECTORY which points outside of DIRECTORY,
i.e. will be unresolvable in the Squashfs filesystem.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -action "exclude @ depth(3)"
Create a Squashfs filesystem containing the two top most levels (contents of
DIRECTORY and immediate sub-directories), and exclude anything at level 3 or
below.
.TP
mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -action "-xattrs-include(^user.) @ type(f)"
Filter the extended attributes but only in regular files (type f), and only
store extended attributes in the user namespace.
.PP
Note: actions should be quoted (as in the above examples), to ensure that they
are passed to Mksquashfs as a single argument, and to ensure that they are not
processed by the shell.
