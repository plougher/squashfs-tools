Help sponsor Squashfs development!

Maintaining and improving Squashfs is a lot of work, but Squashfs is one of
the only widely used Linux file systems that has no company backing.  Squashfs
development is funded solely by the author, partially supported by donations
from companies and individuals that want to improve Squashfs for themselves
and others.

There's lots of exciting new improvements to Squashfs in the pipeline, and
if your company is a serious user of Squashfs, please consider accelerating
development of Squashfs by donating.

Donatations can be made from the Squashfs sourceforge homepage, or if you
prefer by contacting the author privately.
