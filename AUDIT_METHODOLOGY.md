# Security Audit Methodology

This document describes the methodology used to conduct the security audit of squashfs-tools.

## Audit Overview

**Date:** October 2025  
**Duration:** Comprehensive static analysis  
**Approach:** Manual code review with automated tool support  
**Scope:** Complete codebase (96 C files)

## Methodology

### 1. Reconnaissance Phase

#### 1.1 Repository Structure Analysis
```bash
# Identified 96 C source and header files
find squashfs-tools -type f \( -name "*.c" -o -name "*.h" \)

# Key files analyzed:
- mksquashfs.c (7355 lines)
- unsquashfs.c (3141 lines)
- alloc.h (memory allocation wrappers)
- thread.c (multi-threading code)
```

#### 1.2 Build System Review
- Examined Makefile for security flags
- Attempted compilation to understand dependencies
- Identified compiler warnings and options

### 2. Static Analysis Phase

#### 2.1 Pattern Matching for Known Vulnerabilities

**Buffer Overflow Patterns:**
```bash
# Searched for unsafe string functions
grep -rn "strcpy\|strcat\|sprintf\|gets" *.c

# Results:
- strcpy: 8 instances
- strcat: 12 instances
- sprintf: 0 instances (good)
- gets: 0 instances (good)
```

**Memory Management Patterns:**
```bash
# Searched for manual memory allocation
grep -rn "malloc\|calloc\|realloc\|free" *.c

# Findings:
- Most code uses MALLOC/CALLOC/REALLOC wrappers (good)
- Some direct memory operations found
- Analyzed all free() calls for potential double-free
```

**Integer Overflow Patterns:**
```bash
# Searched for overflow protection functions
grep -rn "add_overflow\|multiply_overflow\|shift_overflow" *.c

# Findings:
- Dedicated overflow checking functions exist (good)
- Used in critical allocation paths
- Some calculations lack overflow checks
```

#### 2.2 Manual Code Review

**Focus Areas:**
1. **String Operations**
   - Examined all strcpy/strcat usage
   - Verified buffer size calculations
   - Checked for TOCTOU conditions

2. **Memory Allocation**
   - Traced memory allocation patterns
   - Verified size calculations for integer overflow
   - Checked pointer arithmetic safety

3. **Memory Deallocation**
   - Analyzed free() patterns
   - Looked for use-after-free
   - Checked for double-free scenarios
   - Verified pointer nullification

4. **Array Indexing**
   - Searched for array access without bounds checks
   - Verified loop boundaries
   - Checked for off-by-one errors

5. **Multi-threading**
   - Reviewed mutex usage
   - Looked for race conditions
   - Verified thread-safe operations

### 3. Vulnerability Classification

Each identified issue was classified using:

**Severity Levels:**
- üî¥ **HIGH:** Exploitable, could lead to code execution or data corruption
- üü° **MEDIUM:** Could lead to denial of service or information disclosure
- üü¢ **LOW:** Minor issues, edge cases, or code quality concerns

**Exploitability Assessment:**
- **Easy:** Can be triggered with normal input
- **Moderate:** Requires specific conditions or timing
- **Hard:** Requires multiple factors to align
- **Theoretical:** Not practically exploitable

**Impact Assessment:**
