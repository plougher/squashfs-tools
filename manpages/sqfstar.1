.SH NAME
sqfstar - tool to create a squashfs filesystem from a tar archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
  cat xxx.tar | sqfstar [OPTIONS] FILESYSTEM [exclude files]
  zcat xxx.tgz | sqfstar [OPTIONS] FILESYSTEM [exclude files]
  xzcat xxx.tar.xz | sqfstar [OPTIONS] FILESYSTEM [exclude files]
  zstdcat xxx.tar.zst | sqfstar [OPTIONS] FILESYSTEM [exclude files]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.
It uses either gzip/xz/lzo/lz4/zstd compression to compress both files, inodes
and directories.  Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are
packed to minimise data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported
up to a maximum of 1Mbytes (default block size 128K).

Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained
block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is
needed.
.SH OPTIONS

set data block to BLOCK\-SIZE.  Default 128 Kbytes. Optionally a suffix of K, KB, Kbytes or M, MB, Mbytes can be given to specify Kbytes or Mbytes respectively.
.TP
\fB\-comp\fR COMP
select COMP compression.  Run \fB\-help\-comp\fR COMP to get compressor options for COMP, or ALL for all the compressors. Compressors available: gzip (default), lzo, lz4, xz, zstd.
.TP
\fB\-noI\fR
do not compress inode table.
.TP
\fB\-noId\fR
do not compress the uid/gid table (implied by \fB\-noI\fR).
.TP
\fB\-noD\fR

.SS "Filesystem build options:"
.TP
\fB\-reproducible\fR
build filesystems that are reproducible (default).
.TP
\fB\-not\-reproducible\fR
build filesystems that are not reproducible.
.TP
\fB\-mkfs\-time\fR TIME
set filesystem creation timestamp to TIME. TIME can be an unsigned 32\-bit int indicating seconds since the epoch (1970\-01\-01) or a string value which is passed to the "date" command to parse. Any string value which the date command recognises can be used such as "now", "last week", or "Wed Feb 15 21:02:39 GMT 2023".
.TP
\fB\-all\-time\fR TIME
set all file and directory timestamps to TIME. TIME can be an unsigned 32\-bit int indicating seconds since the epoch (1970\-01\-01) or a string value which is passed to the "date" command to parse. Any string value which the date command recognises can be used such as "now", "last week", or "Wed Feb 15 21:02:39 GMT 2023".
.TP
\fB\-root\-time\fR TIME
set root directory time to TIME. TIME can be an unsigned 32\-bit int indicating seconds since the epoch (1970\-01\-01) or a string value which is passed to the "date" command to parse. Any string value which the date command recognises can be used such as "now", "last week", or "Wed Feb 15 21:02:39 GMT 2023".
.TP
\fB\-root\-mode\fR MODE
set root directory permissions to MODE.  MODE can be symbolic or octal (see section Symbolic mode specification).  Default root mode is ugo=rwx or 0777 octal.
.TP
\fB\-root\-uid\fR VALUE
set root directory owner to specified VALUE, VALUE can be either an integer uid or user name.
.TP
\fB\-root\-gid\fR VALUE
set root directory group to specified VALUE, VALUE can be either an integer gid or group name.
.TP
\fB\-all\-root\fR
make all files and directories owned by root.

\fB\-force\-gid\fR VALUE
set all file and directory gids to specified VALUE, VALUE can be either an integer gid or group name.
.TP
\fB\-default\-mode\fR MODE
tar files often do not store permissions for intermediate directories.  This option sets the default directory permissions to MODE.  MODE can be symbolic or octal (see section Symbolic mode specification). Default mode is u=rwx,go=rx or 0755 octal.  This also sets the root directory mode.
.TP
\fB\-default\-uid\fR VALUE
tar files often do not store uids for intermediate directories.  This option sets the default directory owner to VALUE, rather than the user running Sqfstar. VALUE can be either an integer uid or user name.  This also sets the root directory uid.
.TP
\fB\-default\-gid\fR VALUE
tar files often do not store gids for intermediate directories.  This option sets the default directory group to VALUE, rather than the group of the user running Sqfstar.  VALUE can be either an integer uid or group name.  This also sets the root directory gid.
.TP
\fB\-pseudo\-override\fR
make pseudo file uids and gids override \fB\-all\-root\fR, \fB\-force\-uid\fR and \fB\-force\-gid\fR options.
.TP
\fB\-exports\fR

.SS "Filesystem filter options:"
.TP
\fB\-p\fR PSEUDO\-DEFINITION
add pseudo file definition.  The definition should be quoted.  See section "Pseudo file definition format" later for format details.
.TP
\fB\-pd\fR "d mode uid gid"
specify a default pseudo directory which will be used in pseudo definitions if a directory in the pathname does not exist.  This also allows pseudo definitions to be specified without specifying all the directories in the pathname.  The definition should be quoted.
.TP
\fB\-pd\fR "D time mode uid gid"
specify a default pseudo directory which will be used in pseudo definitions if a directory in the pathname does not exist.  The D type also allows a timestamp to be specified in addition to mode, uid and gid.
.TP
\fB\-pf\fR PSEUDO\-FILE
add list of pseudo file definitions.  Pseudo file definitions in pseudo\-files should not be quoted.
.TP
\fB\-ef\fR EXCLUDE\-FILE
list of exclude dirs/files.  One per line.
.TP
\fB\-regex\fR
allow POSIX regular expressions to be used in exclude dirs/files.
.TP
\fB\-ignore\-zeros\fR
allow tar files to be concatenated together and fed to Sqfstar.  Normally a tarfile has two consecutive 512 byte blocks filled with zeros which means EOF and Sqfstar will stop reading after the first tar file on encountering them. This option makes Sqfstar ignore the zero filled blocks.
.SS "Filesystem extended attribute (xattrs) options:"
.TP
\fB\-no\-xattrs\fR
do not store extended attributes.
.TP
\fB\-xattrs\fR
store extended attributes (default).

exclude any xattr names matching REGEX.  REGEX is a POSIX regular expression, e.g. \fB\-xattrs\-exclude\fR '^user.' excludes xattrs from the user namespace.
.TP
\fB\-xattrs\-include\fR REGEX
include any xattr names matching REGEX.  REGEX is a POSIX regular expression, e.g. \fB\-xattrs\-include\fR '^user.' includes xattrs from the user namespace.
.TP
\fB\-xattrs\-add\fR NAME=VAL
add the xattr NAME with VAL to files.  If an user xattr it will be added to regular files and directories (see man 7 xattr).  Otherwise it will be added to all files.  VAL by default will be treated as binary (i.e. an uninterpreted byte sequence), but it can be prefixed with 0s, where it will be treated as base64 encoded, or prefixed with 0x, where val will be treated as hexadecimal.  Additionally it can be prefixed with 0t where this encoding is similar to binary encoding, except backslashes are specially treated, and a backslash followed by 3 octal digits can be used to encode any ASCII character, which obviously can be used to encode control codes.  The option can be repeated multiple times to add multiple xattrs.

.SH "SYMBOLIC MODE SPECIFICATION"
The symbolic mode is of the format [ugoa]*[[+\-=]PERMS]+.  PERMS = [rwxXst]+ or
[ugo], and the sequence can be repeated separated with commas.
.PP
A combination of the letters ugoa specify which permission bits will be
affected, u means user, g means group, o means other, and a means all or ugo.
.PP
The next letter is +, \- or =.  The letter + means add to the existing permission
bits, \- means remove the bits from the existing permission bits, and = means set
the permission bits.
.PP
The permission bits (PERMS) are a combination of [rwxXst] which
sets/adds/removes those bits for the specified ugoa combination, r means read, w
means write and x means execute for files or search for directories.  X has a
special meaning, if the file is a directory it is equivalent to x or search, but
if it is a non\-directory, it only takes effect if execute is already set for
user, group or other.  The s flag sets user or group ID on execution, and the t
flag on a directory sets restricted deletion, or historically made the file
sticky if a non\-directory.
.PP
The permission bits can also be u, g or o, which takes the permission bits from
the user, group or other of the file respectively.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
sqfstar IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
Create a Squashfs filesystem from the uncompressed tar file "archive.tar".
Sqfstar will use the default compressor (normally gzip), and block size of 128
Kbytes.
.TP
zcat archive.tgz | sqfstar IMAGE.SQFS
Create a Squashfs filesystem from the compressed tar file "archive.tgz". Sqfstar
will use the default compressor (normally gzip), and block size of 128 Kbytes.
.TP
sqfstar -b 1M -comp zstd IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
Use a block size of 1 Mbyte and Zstandard compression to create the filesystem. 
.TP
sqfstar -root-uid 0 -root-gid 0 IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
Tar files do not supply a definition for the root directory, and the default is
to make the directory owned/group owned by the user running Sqfstar.  The above
command sets the ownership/group ownership to root.
.TP
sqfstar -root-mode 0755 IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
The default permissions for the root directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx).  The above
command sets the permissions to 0755 (rwxr-xr-x).
.TP
sqfstar -all-time now IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
Set all file and directory timestamps to "now" (current time) in the filesystem.
.TP
sqfstar -force-uid phillip -force-gid phillip IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
Make all files and directories in the filesystem owned by "phillip".
.TP
sqfstar -force-file-mode ugo+r,go-w IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
Make all files readable by everyone, but only writable by user, all other
permission bits are unaffected.
.TP
sqfstar IMAGE.SQFS file1 file2 < archive.tar
Exclude file1 and file2 from the tar file when creating filesystem.
.TP
sqfstar IMAGE.SQFS "*.gz" < archive.tar
Exclude any files in the top level directory which matches the wildcard pattern
"*.gz".
.TP
sqfstar IMAGE.SQFS "... *.gz" < archive.tar
Exclude any file which matches the wildcard pattern "*.gz" anywhere within the
tar file.  The initial "..." indicates the wildcard pattern is "non-anchored"
and will match anywhere.
.PP
Note: when passing wildcarded names to Sqfstar, they should be quoted (as in
the above examples), to ensure that they are not processed by the shell.

.SS Using pseudo file definitions
.TP
sqfstar -p "build_dir d 0644 0 0" IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
Create a directory called "build_dir" in the output filesystem.
.TP
sqfstar -p "version.txt l /tmp/build/version" IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
Create a reference called "version.txt" to a file not in the tar archive,
which acts as if that file was in the tar archive.
.TP
sqfstar -p "date.txt f 0644 0 0 date" IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
Create a file called "date.txt" which holds the output (stdout) from running
the "date" command.
.TP
sqfstar -p "\\"hello world\\" f 0644 0 0 date" IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
As above, but, showing that filenames can have spaces, if they are quoted.
The quotes need to be blackslashed to protect them from the shell.
.TP
sqfstar -p "input f 0644 root root dd if=/dev/sda1 bs=1024" IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
Create a file containing the contents of partition /dev/sda1".  The above allows
input from these special files to be captured and placed in the Squashfs
filesystem.
.PP
Note: pseudo file definitions should be quoted (as in the above examples), to
ensure that they are passed to Mksquashfs as a single argument, and to ensure
that they are not processed by the shell.
